Scrumdinger - SwiftUI Learning Journey ðŸ“±

Following this Apple Official Tutorial I've learnt a ton of SwiftUI, previously I have studied for 3 months Swift programming language.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

Scrumdinger is a meeting management app that helps teams organize and track their daily scrums. This project follows Apple's official SwiftUI tutorial and demonstrates modern iOS development practices.

ðŸš€ What I've Learned

SwiftUI Fundamentals

Declarative UI Programming: Building interfaces by describing what the UI should look like rather than how to build it
View Composition: Creating complex UIs by combining simple, reusable views
State Management: Understanding @State, @Binding, @ObservableObject, and @EnvironmentObject
Data Flow: How data flows through SwiftUI views and updates the UI automatically
